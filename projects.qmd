## Climate

*downscaling, characterisation, definition, multi-scale, …*

### DownClim

*G. Vieilledent, T. Arsouze, Achille Mauri*

-   Problem: a lot of local projection rely on downscales GCM projections with very low spatial resolution on known baseline (e.g. CHELSA, WolrdClim, ...)
-   DownClim derive projections from CORDEX regionalisation experiments [@platts2014] on a defined baseline
-   Study area: French Guiana, New Caledonia, Ivory Coast. Opportunistic following G. Vieilledent and B. Hérault needs but also different hypothesis. New Caledonia as an important topographic variation. Ivory Coast as an important climatic variations. On the opposite French Guiana is mainly lowland and homogeneous as a control.
-   Validation: (1) explore the possibility to do a projection on observed year (e.g. 2005\>2020) even if the differences between scenarii (RCP or SSP) will not be significant, and (2) explore the difference on ecology for instance with forest climatic extent with this product versus classical products.

## Forest

*tipping point, die-back, degradation, deforestation, large-scale, theory, ecology, dynamcis*

### Amazonian Landscape in Transition

*I. Maréchaux, J. Chave, F. Fischer*

[ALT webpage](https://main–altpages.netlify.app/)

1.  TROLL V4 description (*IM*)
2.  TROLL V4 validation Paracou, Santarèm (*SS*)
3.  Role of biodiversity in response to climate change locally (postodoc Isa)
4.  Forest response to CC projected to the scale of French Guiana (postdoc Jérôme)
5.  Regeneration dynamics (m2 Mélaine)

### *Regeneration of exploited Amazonian forests in the face of climate change (project to develop)*

*I Maréchaux, G Derroire, M Aubry-Kientz, C Piponiot-Laroche, et al.*

*Simulation of forest response to logging in relation to climate change in selectively logged Amazonian forests, taking advantage of TmFO, TROLL and LoggingLab. Possibly extended to other continents with for instance CI data. Discuss funding with Plinio & Valéry. Discuss idea with Jérôme and Isabelle.*

### *Paracou dynamics under climate change across scales (idea)* {style="color: grey"}

*Dynamics (mainly growth) of individuals, species, and forest locally (inventories, fluxes) and remotely sensed (TROMPOMI SIF...) in time starting from TreeGrowth results against local (Guyaflux), remotely sensed (e.g. MODIS) and reanalysed (e.g. ERA5-Land) climates (exploring tipping points with AR(1)).*

## Landscape

*territory, remote sensing, management, local actors*

### Landscape trajectories and local climate

*L. Blanc, J. Betbeder, Marion Chesnes, Betriz Bellon, Guido Briceño*

-   Indices to support management
-   Effect of lande use cover changes, degradation and deforestation, on climate
-   Example for Temperature following @butt2023
-   *Projections with future climates?*
-   *DB Mato Grosso and regional climate changes?*
-   Amazonian landscape trajectory in Brazil explored by B. Bellon
-   Could be linked to tropical moist forest fires using several products (e;g. MapBiomass, TMF, ...)
-   Currently for IDEAS & TerrAmaz
-   [IDAES webpage](https://sylvainschmitt.github.io/ideas/)

## Basin {style="color: grey"}

### *Amazon forests climatic typology (idea)* {style="color: grey"}

*N. Phillipon, V. Gond*

*Characterization of different forest types in relation to climate/season (radiation, cloud, precipitation, evapotranspiration) and ecosystem dynamics (greenness, GPP, etc., N. Philippon, V. Gond, ...). Similarly to @philippon2019. Beware the importance of hydrology and inundation in Amazonia [@fleischmann2022; @fassoni-andrade2021].*

### *Individual-based projections of the Amazon (idea)* {style="color: grey"}

*Multi-scale modelling of Amazonia with TROLL following @rödig2017, @rödig2018, & @rödig2019 with (1) response to climate change and/or (2) simulation of diversity with validation using ATDN.*

### *The Amazon tipping point* *(idea)* {style="color: grey"}

*Similarly to @dakos2022 and @boulton2022 (but see Tao et al. (in press) Nature Climate Change in response), using multiple entry point for multiple arguments (disc. products with Julie).*
